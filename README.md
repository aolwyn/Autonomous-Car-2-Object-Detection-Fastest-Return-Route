# Autonomous-Car-2-Object-Detection-Fastest-Return-Route
Developed for the course ELEC299, this project was developed as a final project. Using an Arduino + motor shield, the vehicle performs a sensor check before moving towards a marker on the ground. The vehicle is programmed to navigate around two obstacles in its path. If the marker cannot be found after navigating around the two obstacles, it performs a 'corkscrew' algorithm to find the marker before calculating the fastest return path before returning to the starting position. Specific information regarding the algorithms and performance can be found in the report file.
