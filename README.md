# Autonomous-Car-2-Object-Detection-Fastest-Return-Route
Developed for the course ELEC299, this project was developed as a final project. Using an Arduino + motor shield, the vehicle performs a sensor check before moving towards a marker on the ground. The vehicle is programmed to navigate around two obstacles in its path. If the marker cannot be found after navigating around the two obstacles, it performs a 'corkscrew' algorithm to find the marker before returning to the starting position.
